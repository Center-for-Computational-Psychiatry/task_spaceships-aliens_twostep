        <h1>Welcome to the Spaceships and Aliens Game!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>You are a citizen of Earth. In recent years, Earth has run out of rare gems and minerals. As an astronaut working for Secret Government Agency (SGA), you are sent to meet with intergalactic aliens on neighboring planets to find valuable gems around the galaxy.</p>
        <p>In this game, you will earn points for each gem you find. Your mission director has asked you to take 150 trips into space to collect as many valuable gems as possible. </p>
        <p>At the end of this game, you will earn a monetary bonus based on points collected during your mission. Good luck!</p>
        <p>This game takes 10-12 minutes to play. Please set aside time for uninterrupted gameplay.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b><i>When you are ready to play, press any key to continue.</i></b></p>

    <div id="instructions-screen-1" style="display: none;">
        <h1>Game Instructions</h1>
        <p>In this game, you will get points from going to outer space and trading with alien traders. In the first stage, you will decide which spaceship to use to reach one of two alien planets. </p>
        <span class="demo-span">
            <img class="demo-img" src="img/Stage1-demo.png" alt="Stage 1 Example">
        </span>
        <p>Due to unpredictable asteroid activity, each rocket will take you to one of the two planets most of the time and to the other planet sometimes. </p> 
        <p>You will be using the left and right arrow keys to make your selection.</p>
        <p><b><i>Press any key to continue to the next instruction. </i></b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="instructions-screen-2" style="display: none;">
        <h1>Game Instructions</h1>
        <p>In the second stage, after landing on one of the two planets, you will need to choose which alien trader to speak to. </p>
        <span class="demo-span">
            <img class="demo-img" src="img/Stage2-demo.png" alt="Stage 2 Example">
        </span>
        <p>Some aliens trade gems a lot of the time, some aliens do not have many gems and can only offer you dirt. You will have to find which planet and alien has the most gems, but be aware that this will change over time. You will be using the left and right arrow keys to make your selection (left for the left rocket, right for the right rocket).</p>
        <p><b><i>Press any key to continue to the next instruction. </i></b></p>
    </div>
    <div id="instructions-screen-3" style="display: none;">
        <h1>Game Instructions</h1>
        <p>After you make your selection of alien trader, you will find out if you received a gem (+100 points) or some dirt (0 points).</p>
        <br>
        <span class="demo-span">
            <img class="demo-reward" src="img/gem-emerald.png" alt="Valuable Gem">

        </span>
        <br></br>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, you will return to the first stage, and make your new selections (for rockets and aliens) again. You will be making these selections for a total of 150 rounds.</p>
        <p>In total, the game will take 10-12 minutes to play. Before you start the real game, you will have a chance to play a short practice session. </p>
        <p><b><i>Press any key to <u>proceed to the practice session.</u></i></b></p>

        <p>Now is the time to play the real game. </p>
        <p>You will have the opportunity to launch into space 150 times to find gems. </p>
        <p>The game will take 10-12 minutes to play. Please set aside uninterrupted time to play this game.</p>
        <p>Remember, you will earn a monetary bonus based on the number of points you earn in this game. Good luck!</p>

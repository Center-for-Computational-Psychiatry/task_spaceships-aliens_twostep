# Spaceships and Aliens - Two Stage Task

Spaceships and Aliens is a game designed to implement the original two-stage task paradigm an an online environment. 

The two-step task, also known as the two-stage task, is a experiment designed to assess decision-making processes in a controlled interactive environment. 

Participants are tasked with navigating a two-stage decision-making process involving choices between different options, with the goal of maximizing point accumulation through strategic selections.

## Experimental Design

### Overview
The Two-Step Task Game simulates a resource-gathering mission where participants act as astronauts tasked with collecting valuable gems from alien traders. The game consists of two stages:

### Rocket Selection (Stage 1)
Alien Trader Selection (Stage 2)
Participants will make 150 selections throughout the game, which are tracked to measure decision-making efficiency and adaptability.

### Stage 1: Rocket Selection
**Objective:** Choose between two rockets to travel to one of two planets.
**Mechanics:** Each rocket is associated with a probabilistic outcome of landing on one of the two planets. The association between rockets and planets is not fixed and varies probabilistically.
**Controls:**
LEFT ARROW key: Selects the left rocket. RIGHT ARROW key: Selects the right rocket.

### Stage 2: Alien Trader Selection
**Objective:** Upon arriving at a planet, choose between two alien traders.
**Mechanics:** The alien traders offer either valuable gems or non-valuable dirt. The distribution of gems and dirt varies over time, introducing dynamic changes to the trading environment.
**Controls:** LEFT ARROW key: Selects the left alien trader. RIGHT ARROW key: Selects the right alien trader.
